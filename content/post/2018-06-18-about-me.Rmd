Hi! My name is Emiliana Delgado, I'm from Caracas, Venezuela. I'm currently a student at Bentley University, majoring in Economics-Finance and also pursuing a liberal arts degree in Global Perspectives. I also have a minor in Entrepreneurship. I'm very interested in politics, economics, and technology. 

My hobbies include jogging, playing tennis, snowboarding, hanging out with my friends, and watching every movie and TV show on Netflix. 

My favorite food is pasta. If I had to eat one dish for the rest of my life it would be a Spaghetti Bolognese.

```{r pie chart, echo=FALSE}
slices <- c(90, 10) 
lbls <- c("Pasta", "Pasta but in blue")
pct <- round(slices/sum(slices)*100)
lbls <- paste(lbls, pct) # add percents to labels 
lbls <- paste(lbls,"%",sep="") # ad % to labels 
pie(slices,labels = lbls, col=rainbow(length(lbls)),
  	main="My favorite foods")
```
