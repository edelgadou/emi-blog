The R package me and Abigail created is called TrainTest. The package makes it possible to use a function called "train_test()", which takes in a csv file from the current R project folder you are using in quotes (ex: "file_name.csv"), the train set percentage, and the test set percentage. The function reads the csv file and creates a train and test set from the specified percentages. The output is a list where the first index returns the training set and the second index refers to the testing set. 

Example of naming train and test set after running: data <- train_test("train_copy.csv", 0.7, 0.3), 
train <- data[1], test <- data[2].
